# Quickline Website

This is a fully responsive website that I've built for the September 2017 session of Code Louisville's Front End Web Development class. 
I've used several different technologies in this project including: 
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Javascript
+ jQuery
+ Bootstrap 4

Some of the highlights of the project are:
+ Parallax background images
+ CSS keyframe animations
+ Photo Lightbox
+ Email Validation
